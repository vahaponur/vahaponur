#### 🔥 Who Am I?

- 🏭 **Reluctant entrepreneur**, invoicing by day, building cool things by night.
- 🐹 **Golang Goblin** – compiling code faster than your enterprise can schedule a meeting, yet still slower than the average .NET developer's ejaculation time.
- 🎮 **Game Dev AI Tool Addict**, because blowing my money on custom AI agents (Meshy,Hunyuan, Claude Code, etc.) feels way better than payin 80$ to bOrDeRLaNdS.
- 🖥️ **Cross‑platform rebel** – refusing to ship binaries for Windows until Microsoft admits Clippy was the original spyware. *(Except when writing Unity games in C#, because apparently Bill Gates decided JavaScript wasn't good enough—maybe Clippy whispered something in his ear.)*
- 🎧 **Bedroom DJ / professional dance‑floor disruptor** → [SoundCloud: asycned](https://soundcloud.com/asycned).
- 🧘 **Wellness fanatic**, able to achieve inner peace but unable to reach my toes.
- 📸 **Insta‑stalking:** [@kacmissenkron](https://instagram.com/kacmissenkron).
- 🕹️ **Standard nerd:** games, books, and endless late‑night Wikipedia rabbit holes.
- 🧠 **Smarter than every made-up corporate title (product manager, owner, yada yada) on the planet**, yet still too dumb to understand Rust’s garbage collector.

#### 💣 Life Goals

1. Patch society's inheritance system to balance the game.
2. Gently remind the privileged that empathy isn't DLC.
3. Hack side‑projects until empathy becomes open‑source.

#### 🤬 Vendor Raid Bosses

- **Microsoft Windows:** Forcibly restarting my machine mid‑clutch coding session to install yet another *critical* emoji‑font patch.
- **Microsoft 365 (Teams in particular):** Consuming more RAM than Chrome on a Netflix binge—and that's saying something.
- **IBM:** Selling yesterday’s “enterprise innovation” at tomorrow’s prices since 1911.
- **IBM CPLEX:** A glorified Sudoku solver that turns optimization into frustration.
- **SAP:** Turning every simple invoice into a 12‑week consulting side quest (billed per click, naturally).
- **Google:** Making users into products while somehow gifting humanity Golang—proving even evil empires can occasionally do good.

#### 🛠️ Stack Overflow

```go
import (
    "golang.org/x/💚"
    "github.com/vahaponur/empathy-as-a-service"
)
```

- **Main Weapon:** Go (because simplicity is underrated).
- **Containers:** 🐳 Docker—the only shipping I endorse.
- **CI/CD:** Bash scripts written with the emotional stability of a ransom note.
